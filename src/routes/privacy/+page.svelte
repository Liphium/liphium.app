		<h1>Liphium Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Effective: 10.01.2024, last updated: 10.01.2024</strong> <br />
			Liphium is designed to be a secure and private messaging app. This Privacy Policy explains how
			we collect, use, store, disclose, and protect your personal information when you use our app. By
			using Liphium or any of our other services/apps/websites, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Definitions</h2>
		<p>
			Because I don’t wanna explain everything ten thousand times here, we'll first define some key
			things that you can do on our platform so you know what we’re talking about when mentioning it
			later.
		</p>

		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				When we say “Liphium”, “us”, “our” or “we” in this document, we are referring collectively
				to the entirety of the Liphium platform, encompassing apps, websites, services, and any
				other associated products developed or owned by Julian Golenhofen (me, the developer of this
				whole thing).
			</li>
			<li>
				When we say our “services” in this document, this encompasses all products, apps, websites,
				and services directly linked to the Liphium platform, as well as any other apps or products
				associated with Liphium.
			</li>
			<li>
				When we mention “your content” in this document or other related documents we mean all the
				things you upload, share, post, add, contribute or stream to our services. This encompasses,
				but is not limited to, texts, images, voice recordings, videos, files, and any other kind of
				content you upload to our platform. Additionally, any future methods or features enabling
				users to upload content to our platform are also included in this definition.
			</li>
			<li>
				In this document, the terms "you" or "your" are employed to specifically address and
				reference you as the user of the Liphium platform.
			</li>
			<li>
				When we mention "encryption keys'' or simply "keys'', we are specifically referring to all
				keys associated with your Liphium account. It's crucial to be aware that sharing these keys
				with others may grant them the capability to decrypt any content you have uploaded to the
				Liphium platform, provided it was encrypted using one of these keys.
			</li>
			<li>
				When mentioning “friends”, in this document, we are referring specifically to other Liphium
				accounts that you have added to your contacts list on our services. We will refer to any
				account you add to this list as a “friend”. You can add other Liphium accounts by sending
				them a “friend request”. Each Liphium user possesses a unique username along with a “tag”,
				which is a short, unique sequence of characters used to identify the user together with
				their username. By using the tag and username of another Liphium user, you can add them to
				your contacts list (provided they accept the request). If someone is in your contacts list,
				you will automatically share your status and all other profile-related information with them
				(more on that data later).
			</li>
			<li>
				Throughout this document, the term “conversations'' or "chats" refers to all interactions
				you initiate with other Liphium accounts or friends on our platform. Within these
				conversations, you can exchange messages and share various types of data. To uphold the
				privacy and security of these interactions, an encryption key is employed. This key ensures
				that the content of your messages and shared data remains private and secure. Importantly,
				any Liphium account participating in the conversation has the ability to add new accounts to
				it. Once added, these new accounts gain access to all messages or data shared within the
				existing conversation, enhancing the collaborative and inclusive nature of our platform.
			</li>
			<li>
				When we mention something about your “profile” or “status”, we are referring to any
				information you have on your “profile page”. The profile page is a place everyone who has
				your profile key (see the “Data Security” section below) can decrypt and read. This includes
				a “status message” that can be set by you and will be shared with everyone in your friend
				list. This may also include additional information we may add to the profile page in the
				future.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Consent</h2>
		<p>
			By using any of our products, apps, services or other products related to Liphium and this
			website you agree to this Privacy Policy.
		</p>

		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>
			We are not responsible for any encryption failures or technical issues that may cause
			information to get out because you are using any non official versions of our apps or
			services. For example, if you modify the app to not encrypt files uploaded to our services, we
			are not responsible if these documents get leaked. We are also not responsible for data that
			is leaked because you share your encryption keys or other sensitive information with other
			people.
		</p>

		<h1>1. What Information We Collect:</h1>
		<p>
			We try to collect as little data as possible to make our services work and try to make sure
			they are encrypted when they are really sensitive. There are multiple ways we collect
			information from you: The information you provide and the information we generate
			automatically.
		</p>

		<h2>1.1 Information you provide to us:</h2>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create a Liphium account, you need to come up
				with a username and tag used to identify you on the Liphium platform. This is stored together
				with your email address (for account recovery and verification), password and other information
				you enter when registering an account (such as the invite you need to create an account in the
				pre-release version of our app). The password is cryptographically hashed before storage and
				the other information is stored normally.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>The content you upload:</strong> This encompasses any content you upload or share on
				our services, such as messages, files, or status updates through profile data. Additionally,
				it includes your profile information and details shared when creating conversations. Any
				members of a conversation you join may get access to either parts or all of the data
				associated with your account. We do not typically store the contents of video or voice calls
				as they are encrypted but we may store short parts of them to improve the quality of the
				experience. In the event of any changes to this practice in the future, we will inform you
				in advance. The content you upload and the way it is shared is all in accordance to our
				terms of service (<a href="#">LINK HERE</a>).
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Interactions with the app:</strong> We gather data about your interactions with Liphium
				and your activities on our services. This encompasses the friends you add (although they are
				encrypted in the database, so anyone with database access can’t see them), your interactions
				with other Liphium users, the settings you toggle on and off (for example, to sync them between
				devices and evaluate how many people use certain things), the features you use (anonymously collected,
				mostly to see if the additions we make are actually good), and other data that may be generated
				through actions you take. We plan to have a way to show you the data we collect in the future.
				We are committed to give you a good way to control all your data, delete it and make the experience
				good and not frustrating.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Information you provide directly:</strong> You have the option to participate in surveys
				to offer feedback on our services (this information is anonymous and your identity will never
				be revealed when showing the results of these surveys internally) or submit information to our
				Liphium support team (this information is only stored to potentially resolve your case).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>1.2 Information we collect automatically or generate:</h2>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Information that is necessary for operation:</strong> We often generate bits of data
				that are used for core functionality of the app when you initiate certain actions on our services.
				For example, when creating an account for our services for the first time, we generate encryption
				keys that are used to keep your data safe on our platform (for example when sharing profile data
				with friends). Some of these keys will be sent to the server in an encrypted form so we cannot
				access them in any way. Other examples include cryptographic signatures we may generate on the
				client for the verification of ownership of messages or files you upload to our services. This
				data is necessary for our services to operate and they cannot operate without this data.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Device and usage data:</strong> We may collect information about your device (such as
				your operating system or browser, your screen resolution or size, your system hardware, etc.)
				and the way you use our services to help us improve the user experience and see what errors you
				run into and how we can fix them for you. It also helps us find device-specific issues like an
				interface being bugged on a very special kind of device. This also helps us to see how many people
				are actually using the features we put out as well as to evaluate which parts of our services
				are rarely used. This helps us to find out which areas might need improvement and which stuff
				to work on next.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>2. How We Collect Information:</h1>
		<p>We collect information when you:</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				Enter any input on our services. For example, when you enter information about your account
				when creating an account we collect that information to create your account.
			</li>
			<li>
				When you have the app open. Sometimes we may store information about your current session or
				errors that occur when receiving messages (that can happen by just having the app open).
			</li>
			<li>
				When you click on certain elements. For example, when you click on conversations in our
				service we may send a request to the server to let your other devices know that you read the
				conversation. This information will also be stored. This may also include certain settings
				like the invites page in the settings where we store the history of invites you generate on
				the server.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>3. Purpose of Collection:</h1>
		<p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				To provide you with our services. We use your information to operate our services. For
				example, if we don’t store the messages you send into a conversation that would mean that
				every user had to be online at all times which would be very inconvenient. We also use the
				information to make features work. For example, when you select a new status message on your
				profile, we store it and send it to all your friends since you want them to see it (if you
				don’t just don’t set it).
			</li>
			<li>
				To contact you. Information like your email address is required to let you know about
				changes on our platform or changes related to your account (like password changes, etc.).
			</li>
			<li>
				To provide you with support. We use the information you provide to us when you report an
				issue or have questions about anything to help you out with your issue or question. For
				example, when you report a bug we’ll use that information to figure out how to possibly fix
				it.
			</li>
			<li>
				To protect our services. We use information to keep our services secure and prevent misuse
				by for example rate-limiting your requests to certain endpoints to make sure you don’t suck
				our bank account dry.
			</li>
			<li>
				To improve user experience. We use information like your usage of our app to improve the
				experience for you and try to add features that actually make your life easier.
			</li>
			<li>
				To comply with the law. We store some of your data in connection with potential legal claims
				when necessary and for compliance, regulatory, and auditing purposes. For example, we need
				to store certain information if we are required to do so by law.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>4. Data Security:</h1>
		<p>
			We prioritize the security of your information, so here are some methods we use to keep your
			information secure. We are committed to rigorously test these methods to ensure their
			effectiveness and reliability and to improve them in the future in case there is room for
			improvement.
		</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Liphium employs end-to-end encryption to secure the conversations
				between Liphium accounts. This means that the content of your messages, including texts, images,
				voice messages, and any other attached content, is encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted
				by the intended recipient's device or any one who has previously received access to the key for
				encryption in the conversation. This ensures that the content remains private and secure during
				transit and storage and reduces the risk of getting your data to leak.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Profile-based Encryption:</strong> Liphium incorporates encryption for any content shared
				with friends collectively, specifically content shared not within a private conversation but
				directly with all or a limited group of friends, referred to as "profile data''. All profile
				data is encrypted using a unique profile key (generated when creating an account, see “1.2 Information
				we automatically generate”). When you send a friend request to someone, they receive this key,
				enabling them to decrypt and access the shared profile data. It's important to note that all
				profile data is publicly available, and the only protection it has is through this encryption
				key. Note that you are responsible for this key not being shared with other people than your
				friends.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Good security practices:</strong> We don’t say state-of-the-art security practices here
				because security practices get better by the day. We try to keep up with the current state of
				securing your data and want to make sure it’s stored as well as we can. For this reason we use
				really strong passwords for all of our service providers that make Liphium work. We also try
				to limit the data these service providers can read. Read more below.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Protection on every request.</strong> We are committed to never share any of your personal
				data with service providers even if they say they won’t do anything with it. For example, we
				currently have a custom protocol on top of HTTPS that is used to protect you from getting data
				leaked to Cloudflare (which is our DDoS protection and SSL provider). Cloudflare could technically
				read all the data sent to our servers, but with our custom protocol this is no longer possible
				unless Cloudflare decides to suddenly modify requests (we will fight back in case that happens).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>5. Data Sharing:</h1>
		<p>
			We do not sell your personal information. We share information with third parties only for the
			following purposes:
		</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Hosting and infrastructure services.</strong> Some of our service providers may log data
				sent through their systems. One example is Cloudflare although we limit what they can see by
				using a custom protocol on top of HTTPS (read more in the “4. Data Security” section). Although
				they personally say they don’t log anything, we still wanted to make sure they can’t even do
				so in the first place.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Bug reports and questions.</strong> If you contact our support we may share the data
				you give us with the responsible teams or people to help them resolve the issues. Especially
				as Liphium as a company grows we will have more teams that need to work together to solve these
				issues. If for example a bug report is not provided to the development team by the support team
				the development team doesn’t really have a way to fix that bug. With the data about the issue
				personal information about the user might be included to evaluate if the bug has something to
				do with the account of the user.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Database and storage providers.</strong> Our providers for file storage (currently Cloudflare,
				could change without any update here) may have access to the files you upload to our platform
				(although they should be encrypted) since we store them using their service. Additionally our
				database providers (currently fly.io, could change without being updated here) may be able to
				read any information stored on our systems.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are also other times when we may need to share your information with some entities or
			third parties.
		</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Legal requirements.</strong> We need to share your information to meet any applicable
				law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request. For example, if there would
				be some sort of chat control law somewhere, we would have to share your conversations with these
				people. Although that hopefully doesn’t happen.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Enforcing our terms.</strong> We may share your information to enforce applicable Terms,
				including investigation of potential violations. If you break our terms, we’re gonna have to
				make sure we find you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>To prevent bugs and make Liphium secure.</strong> We may share information to detect,
				prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues. For example, if there is
				a technical issue within our services we may take a look at some of your information to figure
				out what's wrong.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Protecting you.</strong> We also share information to protect against harm to the rights,
				property, or safety of Liphium, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law. For
				example, if someone tries to harm the safety of Liphium we may share that data to investigate
				the situation.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>6. Data Retention:</h1>
		<p>
			We retain personal information until we no longer need it to keep up the functionality of our
			services or until it is no longer required for legal purposes. There are generally different
			types of data on our platform that may be kept for different time intervals.
		</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Data that needs to reach a destination.</strong> For example, when you send a message
				on our services it is usually only kept for one month or more if required to send the message
				to the desired recipient. If you then edit the same message it will extend the length of storage
				with another 30 days. We do this to make sure the things you send arrive at the desired location.
				Messages can also be stored longer than the 30 day period since it may take the server some time
				to delete it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Data that is stored until you delete your account.</strong> Some data is kept until you
				decide to get rid of it by either deleting your account or deleting it directly. For example,
				when setting a profile picture on our services we keep it until you get rid of it. It would be
				really weird if your profile picture would suddenly disappear, you know.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>7. User Rights:</h1>
		<p>
			We want to make sure that you have control over your data. You have the right to access,
			rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of your personal data and also to:
		</p>
		<ul class="bullet-list">
			<li>
				<strong>Access and review your personal information.</strong> If you want to see what personal
				information we have about you, please contact us. We retain the right to make you pay for this
				service as it may not be viable to keep this open for free. We are planning on adding options
				to see your personal data on the platform, but for now you’ll have to contact us about it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Correct any inaccuracies in your information.</strong> If you have anything you want
				changed about your information you may do so in the settings for your account in the app you
				are using. If you can’t change the thing you are looking for contact us and we’ll see if it is
				something we can do for you. Let me remind you that we cannot change encrypted information as
				we don’t have any access to it ourselves.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Delete your account and associated data.</strong> You can always delete your account
				in the settings of your app. If this feature isn’t available to you for some reason, please contact
				us.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Children protection</h2>
		<p>
			Another part of our priority is adding protection for children while using the internet. We
			encourage parents and guardians to observe, participate in, and/or monitor and guide their
			online activity. Liphium does not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from
			children under the age of 13. If you think that your child provided this kind of information
			to our services, we strongly encourage you to contact us immediately and we will do our best
			efforts to promptly remove such information from our records.
		</p>

		<h1>8. Policy Changes:</h1>
		<p>
			We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
			significant changes through the app or any other ways of contacting you. We will also always
			change the date in the beginning of these terms to the last time the policy was changed.
		</p>

		<h1>9. Contact Information:</h1>
		<p>
			For questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or any other privacy related questions,
			please contact us at liphiumstuff@gmail.com (working on getting our own domain as an email
			address).

		<p>
			Thank you for choosing Liphium. Your privacy is important to us and I hope that you continue
			to use our app for communicating with your friends!
